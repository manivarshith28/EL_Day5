# EL_Day5

In this task, I created two tables — `employee` and `department` — which share a common attribute: `emp_id`. This common field allows the use of SQL joins. I performed several join queries (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) to explore how data from both tables can be combined based on this relationship.
